# 🚀 TaskFly - The Fun Job Scheduler Daemon

No more struggling with cryptic cron syntax or limited job control. TaskFly lets you schedule tasks according to their urgency level, represented by fun emojis! Experience the power and flexibility of a robust job scheduler with the simplicity and user-friendliness of emojis.

## 🤔 What is TaskFly?

TaskFly is a daemon designed to make task scheduling easy, flexible, and fun. Instead of grappling with complex scheduling syntax, you simply assign your tasks an urgency level using one of four emojis. TaskFly takes care of the rest, ensuring your tasks are executed at the right time based on their urgency, all while providing robust control and monitoring capabilities.

Here are the available urgency levels:

- 🚀 Blast Off: Super urgent tasks that need to be executed within the next 30 minutes.
- ✈️ Jet Stream: Urgent tasks that need to be executed within the next 2 hours.
- 🚲 Daily Cruise: Tasks that need to be executed by the end of the day.
- 🐢 Turtle Pace: Tasks that can wait to be executed sometime this week.

With TaskFly, you're not just scheduling tasks - you're controlling a powerful, flexible daemon that handles job dependencies, manages job execution environments, provides direct feedback on job statuses, and offers a centralized dashboard for monitoring all your tasks.
